    "## 📊 Detailed Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **DistilBERT**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Designed by *distilling* the original BERT, reducing model size and compute while retaining much of the base model’s performance. ([Hugging Face][8])\n",
    "* Typically retains ~95-97% of BERT’s benchmarks with ~40% fewer parameters and ~60% faster inference. ([Bard AI][4])\n",
    "* Excellent for low-resource scenarios or where inference speed matters.\n",
    "* **Quantization:** well supported by common ML toolchains (Hugging Face Optimum, ONNX, TensorRT etc.) for FP16/INT8 to greatly reduce memory & speed up inference. ([transformersum.readthedocs.io][6])\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **ModernBERT**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A recent next-generation encoder model introducing rotary positional embeddings, longer context windows (up to 8192 tokens), Flash Attention, and local-global attention patterns. ([Hugging Face][5])\n",
    "* Achieves **stronger performance than many traditional encoders** on GLUE benchmarks, retrieval tasks (BEIR), and code retrieval benchmarks. ([Hugging Face][1])\n",
    "* Higher resource footprint than DistilBERT but still optimized for high throughput using modern GPU primitives. ([Hugging Face][5])\n",
    "* **Quantization:** support is currently limited; while quantized checkpoints exist, official quantization workflows (e.g., Hugging Face Optimum) may not yet support ModernBERT out of the box. ([GitHub][7])\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **RoBERTa**\n",
    "\n",
    "* An evolution of BERT with optimized training (no next sentence prediction, larger training corpus/hyperparameters), leading to improved performance on many benchmarks.\n",
    "* Parameter counts and compute are larger than DistilBERT; accurate and reliable but heavier for production deployment.\n",
    "* **Quantization:** mature support across inference toolchains, enabling significant speed and memory reductions for deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 Summary Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "* **If efficiency and light deployment matters:** **DistilBERT** — fast, small, wide quantization support.\n",
    "* **If maximum quality + modern architecture for long texts:** **ModernBERT** — strong benchmarks, fast long-context inference, but quantization tooling is still catching up.\n",
    "* **If robust, established performance with tooling support:** **RoBERTa** — accurate across many tasks with mature quantization support.\n",
